# MAGD150 - 2018 - Brad Kornely

## Project 1  

For this project I created a simple tower. This tower has windows lined on each side, with a space in the middle. I used points for the windows, which now I relized was a mistake. The approach I would take now is to use rect or ellipse objects; doing so would allow me to customize them a bit more.

## Project 4  

I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why the keypress event was creating copies of my drawn objects and not deleting the left over elements on the last frame, I now relize that is because I put the background function in the setup block instead of the draw block.

## Project 5  

This is one of my better projects because it actually works properly and I didnt have very many problems writting the code for it. The only issue I have is that when you click the red button, sometimes the keypress even doesnt trigger. I learned that this is because the midpoint of the ellipse is centered on the object as apposed to being in the upper left corner like the green button that is a rectangle.

## Project 6  

This is another one that I like a lot because I had fun setting the movement for the clouds and sun. I now relize that I should have made the sun move across the sky and not side to side.

## Project 7

This one was a bit more challenging for me because I was not very good with using fractions of an ellipse. Also getting the movement consistent for all of the parts was challenging.
